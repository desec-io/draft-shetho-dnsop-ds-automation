            Best Practice Recommendations for DS Automation
                draft-shetho-dnsop-ds-automation-latest

Abstract

   Enabling support for automatic acceptance of DS parameters from the
   Child DNS operator (via RFCs 7344, 8078, 9615) requires the parent
   operator, often a registry or registrar, to make a number of
   technical decisions.  This document describes recommendations for new
   deployments of such DS automation.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7344], [RFC8078], [RFC9615] automate DNSSEC delegation trust
   maintenance by having the child publish CDS and/or CDNSKEY records
   which indicate the delegation's desired DNSSEC parameters ("DS
   automation").

   Parental Agents using these protocols have to make a number of
   technical decisions.  These include:

   *  What kind of validity checks should be performed on DS parameters?

   *  Should those checks be performed upon acceptance, or also
      continually when in place?

   *  How do TTLs and caching impact DS provisioning?  How important is
      timing in a child key change?

   *  Should a successful or rejected DS update trigger a notification
      to anyone?

   *  How are conflicts resolved when DS parameters are accepted through
      multiple channels (e.g. via a conventional channel and via
      automation)?

   In case of the RRR model used for many top-level domains, a registrar
   interacts with the registry in the name of the registrant (domain
   owner), and can effect parent-side changes to the delegation.  In
   such a situation where there are multiple effective parent-side
   actors, additional questions arise:

   *  Should DS automation involve the registrar or the registry, or
      both?

   *  If both are automating DS updates, how to resolve potential
      collisions?

   *  What is the relationship with other registration state parameters,
      such as registry or registrar locks?

   Not all existing DS automation deployments have made the same choices
   with respect to these questions, leading to somewhat inconsistent
   behavior.  From the perspective of a domain owner with domain names
   under various TLDs, this may be unexpected and confusing.

   New deployments of DS automation therefore SHOULD follow the
   recommendations set out in this document, to achieve a more uniform
   treatment across suffixes and to minimize user surprise.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with DNSSEC
   [RFC9364][RFC9615][I-D.ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify].

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   Unless defined in this section, the terminology in this document is
   as defined in [RFC7344].

   Child zone:  A DNS zone whose delegation is in the Parent zone

   Child (DNS operator):  DNS operator responsible for a Child zone.

   DNS (Zone) Operator:  The entity holding the primary copy of the zone
      before it is signed.  Typically a DNS hosting provider in the
      domain owner's name, it controls the authoritative contents and
      delegations in the zone, and is thus operationally responsible for
      maintaining the "purposeful" records in the zone file (such as IP
      address, MX, or CDS/CDNSKEY records).  The parties involved in
      other functions for the zone, like signing and serving, are not
      relevant for this definition.

   Parent zone:  A DNS zone that holds a delegation for a Child zone

   Parent (DNS operator):  The DNS operator responsible for a Parent
      zone, and thus involved with the maintenance of the delegation's
      DNSSEC parameters (in particular, the acceptance of these
      parameters and the publication of corresponding DS records).

   Registrant:  The entity responsible for records associated with a
      particular domain name in a domain name registry (typically under
      a TLD such as .com or an SLD such as co.uk).  When the RRR model
      is used, the registrant maintains these records through a
      registrar who acts as an intermediary for both the registry and
      the registrant.

   Registrar:  An entity through which registrants register domain
      names; the registrar performs this service by interacting directly
      with the registry in charge of the domain's suffix.  A registrar
      may also provide other services such as DNS service or web hosting
      for the registrant.  In some cases, the registry directly offers
      registration services to the public, that is, the registry may
      also perform the registrar function.

   Registry:  The entity that controls the registry database and
      authoritative DNS service of domain names registered under a
      particular suffix, for example a top-level domain (TLD).  A
      registry receives requests through an interface (usually EPP
      [RFC5730]) from registrars to read, add, delete, or modify domain
      name registrations, and then makes the requested changes in the
      registry database and associated DNS zone.

   RRR Model:  The registrant-registrar-registry interaction framework,
      where registrants interact with a registrar to register and manage
      domain names, and registrars interact with the domain's registry
      for the provision and management of domain names on the
      registrant's behalf.  This model is common amongst top-level
      domains.

2.  Validity Checks and Safety Measures

   *  What kind of validity checks should be performed on DS parameters?

   *  Should those checks be performed upon acceptance, or also
      continually when in place?

   *  How do TTLs and caching impact DS provisioning?  How important is
      timing in a child key change?

2.1.  Analysis

2.1.1.  Continuity of Resolution

   To maintain the basic resolution function, it is important to avoid
   the deployment of bad DS record sets in the parent zone.  It is
   therefore desirable for the Parent to verify that the DS record set
   resulting from an automated (or even manual) update does not break
   DNSSEC validation if deployed, and otherwise cancel the update.

   This is best done by

   1.  verifying that consistent CDS/CDNSKEY responses are served by all
       of the delegation's nameservers [I-D.ietf-dnsop-cds-consistency];

   2.  verifying that the resulting DS RRset does not break the
       delegation if applied ([RFC7344], Section 4.1), i.e., that it
       provides at least one valid path for validators to use
       ([RFC6840], Section 5.11).  This is the case if there is at least
       one DS record referencing a key that actually signs the child's
       DNSKEY RRset, where the digest type and signing algorithm are
       listed as mandatory ("MUST") in the "Implement for DNSSEC
       Validation" columns of the relevant IANA registries [DS-IANA] and
       [DNSKEY-IANA].

   TODO Should checks be done continually?  (Why is that the parent's
   task?)  Or on demand, e.g., on a no-op NOTIFY?

2.1.2.  TTLs and Caching

   To further reduce the impact of any misconfigured DS record set — be
   it from automated or from manual provisioning — the option to quickly
   roll back the delegation's DNSSEC parameters is of great importance.
   This is achieved by setting a comparatively low TTL on the DS record
   set in the parent domain, at the cost of reduced resiliency against
   nameserver unreachability due to the earlier expiration of cached
   records.  The availability risk can be mitigated by limiting such
   TTLs to a brief time period after a change to the DS configuration,
   during which rollbacks are most likely to occur.

   Registries therefore should significantly lower the DS RRset's TTL
   for some time following an update.  Pragmatic values for the reduced
   TTL value range between 5–15 minutes.  Such low TTLs might be
   expected to cause increased load on the corresponding authoritative
   nameservers; however, recent research has demonstrated them to have
   negligible impact on the overall load of a registry's authoritative
   nameserver infrastructure [LowTTL].

   The reduction should be in effect at least until the previous DS
   record set has expired from caches, that is, the period during which
   the low-TTL is applied should exceed the normal TTL value.  The
   routine re-signing of the DS RRset (usually after a few days)
   provides a convenient opportunity for resetting the TTL.  (TOOD see
   also [I-D.ietf-regext-epp-ttl]?)

   TODO Is this paragraph needed?  It is not necessary to equally reduce
   the old DS RRset's TTL before applying the change.  If this were
   done, the rollover itself would have to be delayed without any
   apparent benefit.  With the goal of enabling timely withdrawal of a
   botched DS RRset, it is not equally important for the previous
   (functional) DS RRset to be abandoned very quickly.  In fact, not
   reducing the old DS TTL has the advantage of providing some
   resiliency against a botched DS update, as clients would continue to
   use the previous DS RRset according to its normal TTL, and the broken
   RRset could be withdrawn without some of them ever seeing it.  Wrong
   DS RRsets will then only gradually impact clients, minimizing impact
   overall.

2.2.  Recommendation

   1.  Entities performing automated DS maintenance SHOULD verify

       *  the consistency of DS update requests across authoritative
          nameservers, and

       *  that the resulting DS record set would not break DNSSEC
          validation if deployed,

       and cancel the update if the verifications do not succeed.

   2.  Parent operators (such as registries) SHOULD reduce a DS record
       set's TTL to a value between 5–15 minutes when it is updated, and
       restore the normal TTL value at a later occasion (but not before
       the old DS RRset's TTL has expired).

3.  Multiple Submitting Parties

   *  How are conflicts resolved when DS parameters are accepted through
      multiple channels (e.g. via a conventional channel and via
      automation)?

   *  In case both the registry and the registrar are automating DS
      updates, how to resolve potential collisions?

3.1.  Analysis

   There are multiple channels through which DS parameters can be
   accepted:

   *  The registry can, through some automated method, receive
      information about intended DS updates directly from the Child DNS
      Operator, and update the DS records;

   *  The registrar can, through some automated method, receive this
      information and relay the information to the registry;

   *  Registrars can obtain the information from the registrant via
      webform submission or other means and relay it to the registry.

   ICANN SSAC has offered the following considerations in this context:

   *  When a manual DS update is performed without ensuring that the
      information informing automated DS maintenance requests (such as
      CDS/DNSKEY records) are updated as well, the delegation's DS
      records may be reset to their previous state at the next run of
      the automation process.  (Note that in case of CDNSKEY/CDS
      processing, these records will only remain valid when signed with
      keys authorized via the manually deployed DS records.  Validity
      checks described in Appendix B.1 further ensure that updates do
      not break validation.)

      Some experts have proposed suspending DS automation once a manual
      DS update has occurred, e.g., until after the Child's SOA serial
      is found to be updated.  While appealing at first glance,
      automatic resumption of DS automation at SOA update time comes
      with a high risk of “timing surprises” – namely, when the SOA
      serial changes for reasons unrelated to the DNSSEC key
      configuration.  Any arbitrary modification to the zone content
      would then suffice to trigger DS automation resumption, including
      the very common updating of DNSSEC signature validity timestamps
      (often a weekly routine).  Furthermore, authoritative nameservers
      may have different serial offsets (e.g. in multi-provider setups),
      so that an apparent serial increase might actually be an illusion.
      It is therefore advised to not follow this practice.

      All things considered, it appears advisable that automated DS
      updates generally not be suspended when a manual DS update has
      occurred.  An exception from this rule is when the entire DS
      record set was removed, in which case the registrant likely wants
      to disable DNSSEC on the delegation.  DS automation should then be
      suspended so that automatic re-initialization (bootstrapping) does
      not occur.  In all other cases, any properly authenticated DS
      updates received through an automated method should be considered
      as the current intent of the domain owner.

   *  Under special circumstances, it may be necessary to perform a
      manual DS update.  One important example is when the
      authentication token or key used by the automated method is
      destroyed, in which case an automatic key rollover is impossible
      as the Child DNS operator can no longer authenticate the
      associated information.  Another example is when several providers
      are involved, but one no longer cooperates (e.g., when removing a
      provider from a multi-provider setup).  Disabling manual DS
      management interfaces is therefore strongly discouraged.

      Similarly, when the registrar is known to not support DNSSEC, it
      seems adequate for registries to not perform automated DS
      maintenance, in order to prevent situations in which a
      misconfigured delegation cannot be manually recovered by the
      registrant (for lack of a manual update interface at the
      registrar).

   *  When the RRR model is used, there is a potential for collision if
      both the registry and the registrar are automating DS updates.
      This collision risk disappears entirely when using “Generalized
      DNS Notifications” for triggering DS maintenance through one
      party's designated endpoint (see Section 4.2.2), and can otherwise
      be mitigated if the registry and registrar agree that only one of
      them will automate DS updates.

      Note that no adverse consequences are expected if both parties
      perform DS automation.  An exception is when during a key
      rollover, registry and registrar see different versions of the
      Child's DS update requests, such as when CDS/CDNSKEY records are
      retrieved from different vantage points.  This may lead to
      flapping of DS updates, which is not expected to be harmful as
      either DS RRset will allow for the validation function to continue
      to work.  The effect subsides as the Child's state eventually
      becomes consistent (expected to occur within one TTL), and can be
      further reduced by checking overlapping update requests for
      consistency.

      As a standard aspect of key rollovers (RFC 6781), the Child DNS
      operator is expected to monitor propagation of Child zone updates
      to all authoritative nameserver instances, and only proceed to the
      next step once replication has succeeded everywhere and the DS
      record set was subsequently updated (and in no case before the DS
      RRset's TTL has passed).  Any breakage resulting from improper
      timing on the Child side is outside of the Parent's sphere of
      influence, and thus out of scope of DS automation considerations.

3.2.  Recommendation

   1.  Registrars and (outside the RRR model) registries SHOULD provide
       a channel for manual DS maintenance in order to enable recovery
       when the Child has lost access to its signing key(s).  It is also
       needed when a DNS operator does not support DS automation or
       refuses to cooperate.

   2.  When DS updates are received through a manual or EPP interface,
       they SHOULD be executed immediately.

   3.  Only when the entire DS record set has been removed through a
       manual or EPP submission SHOULD DS automation be suspended, in
       order to prevent accidental re-initialization of the DS record
       set when the registrant intended to disable DNSSEC.

   4.  In all other cases where a non-empty DS record set is provisioned
       manually or via EPP (including after an earlier removal), DS
       automation SHOULD NOT (or no longer) be suspended.

   5.  In the RRR model, if the registry performs DS automation, the
       registry SHOULD notify the registrar of all DS updates (see also
       Recommendation 4 under Section 5).

   6.  In the RRR model, registries SHOULD NOT perform automated DS
       maintenance if it is known that the registrar does not support
       DNSSEC.

4.  Registration Locks

   *  What is the relationship with other registration state parameters,
      such as EPP locks?

4.1.  Analysis

   Registries and registrars can set various types of locks for domain
   registrations, usually upon the registrant's request.  Some locks
   clearly should have no impact on DS automation (such as
   clientDeleteLock / serverDeleteLock), while for other types of locks,
   in particular “update locks”, the interaction with automated DS
   maintenance is more interesting.

   An overview of the various types of standardized locks and which
   impact on DS automation would appear plausible is given in Table 2.
   Some registries may offer additional types of locks whose meaning and
   set/unset mechanisms are defined according to a proprietary policy.

   TODO: add table

   The only lock types that may be recognized as having an impact on DS
   automation are the ones prohibiting “Update” operations (see first
   “Impact” column in the table).

   When a serverUpdateProhibited lock (“registry lock”) is in place,
   there exists an expectation that this lock renders all otherwise
   updateable registration data immutable.  It seems logical to extend
   this lock to DS updates as well.

   The situation presents itself differently when a
   clientUpdateProhibited lock (“registrar lock”) is in place.  While
   protecting against various types of accidental or malicious change
   (such as unintended changes through the registrar's customer portal),
   this lock is much weaker than the registry lock, as its security
   model does not prevent the registrar's (nor the registry's) actions.
   This is because the clientUpdateProhibited lock can be removed by the
   registrar without an out-of-band interaction.

   Under such a security model, no significant security benefit is
   gained by preventing automated DS maintenance based on a
   clientUpdateProhibited lock alone, while preventing it would make
   maintenance needlessly difficult.  It therefore seems reasonable not
   to suspend automation when such a lock is present.  The remainder of
   this section discusses this in detail.

   In a world without DNSSEC, it was possible for a registration to be
   set up once, then locked and left alone (no maintenance required).
   With DNSSEC comes a change to this operational model: the DNSSEC
   configuration may have to be maintained in order to remain secure and
   operational.  For example, the Child DNS operator may switch to
   another signing algorithm if the previous one is no longer deemed
   appropriate.  Such changes entail updating the delegation's DS
   records.  If authenticated, these operations do not qualify as
   accidental or malicious change, but as normal and appropriate
   activity for securing ongoing operation.

   To accommodate key or algorithm rollovers performed by the Child DNS
   operator, a means for maintaining DS records is needed.  It is worth
   recalling that any authenticated DS update request (such as when
   published via CDS/CDNSKEY records on all nameservers) constitutes a
   legitimate request in the name of the registrant.  Further, the
   resulting DS update is subject to the parent's acceptance checks, and
   not applied when incompatible with the DNSSEC keys published in the
   child zone (see Appendix B.1).

   Given that a clientUpdateProhibited lock protects against unintended
   changes (such as through the customer portal) while not preventing
   actions done by the registrar (or the registry) themself, the lock is
   not suitable for defending against actions performed illegitimately
   by the registrar or registry (e.g., due to compromise).  Any attack
   on the registration data that is feasible in the presence of a
   registrar lock is also feasible regardless of whether DS maintenance
   is done automatically; in other words, DS automation is orthogonal to
   the attack vector that a registrar lock protects against.
   Considering that automated DS updates are required to be
   authenticated and validated for correctness, it thus appears that
   honoring such requests, while in the registrant's interest, comes
   with no additional associated risk.  (Automated DS maintenance may be
   disabled by requesting a registry lock, if so desired.)

   Suspending automated DS maintenance at the registrar or registry
   therefore does not seem justified unless the registration data is
   locked at the registry level (e.g. when the registrant has explicitly
   requested a serverUpdateProhibited lock to be set).  In particular, a
   registrar lock alone provides insufficient grounds for suspending DS
   maintenance.

   Following this line of thought, some registries (e.g., .ch/.cz/.li)
   today perform automated DS maintenance even when an “update lock” is
   in place.  Registries offering proprietary locks should carefully
   consider for each lock whether its scope warrants suspension.

   The situation might appear less clear for DNSSEC bootstrapping, where
   automatic DS initialization is not required to maintain ongoing
   operation.  In the absence of a registry lock, however, it is in the
   interest of security to enable DNSSEC when requested.  The fact that
   a Child is requesting DS initialization through an authenticated,
   automated method expresses the registrant's intent to have the
   delegation secured.  There would seem to be little reason for the
   registrant to take (or order) these preparatory steps if not for
   their request to be acted upon.

   Further, considering that some domains are put into
   clientUpdateProhibited lock by default, not honoring authenticated DS
   initialization requests needlessly imposes an additional burden of
   human intervention for unlocking and relocking the domain in order to
   facilitate DS provisioning after registration, in spite of the
   registrant already having expressed (to their Child DNS operator) the
   intent of securing their domain with DNSSEC.  It therefore appears
   that DS initialization and rollovers should be treated the same way
   with respect to locks, and only be suspended while in
   serverUpdateProhibited lock status.

   An analysis like the above of the security properties of registry and
   registrar locks with respect to automated DS maintenance is so far
   not contained in any specification document.  The SSAC suggests that
   this aspect should be specified more clearly, such as by explicitly
   defining under which locks automated DS maintenance is permissible,
   or by defining a new “maintenance lock” status whose absence would
   indicate that automated DS maintenance is permissible.

4.2.  Recommendation

   tbd

5.  Reporting

   *  Should a successful or rejected DS update trigger a notification
      to anyone?

   Finally, when accepting or rejecting a DS update, it may be helpful
   to notify relevant parties (such as the Child DNS operator or
   registrant).  Such a reporting mechanism may also be used for
   notifications in case a problem is detected with an operational
   (unchanged) DS RRset, such as due to an incompatible change in the
   Child zone.  For details, see Section 5.

5.1.  Analysis

   In general, it cannot be assumed that the Child DNS operator is aware
   of the error conditions observed by the Parent.  For example, they
   may not know that their CDS/CDNSKEY record contents are not
   acceptable to the Parent.  Early reporting of rejected DS updates may
   help the Child DNS operator handle the situation in a timely manner.

   Similarly, a delegation can break even without an update request to
   the DS record set.  Such breakage may occur during key rollovers (RFC
   6781) when the Child DNS operator proceeds to the next step early,
   without verifying that the delegation's DS record set is in the
   expected state.  For example, when an algorithm rollover is performed
   and the old signing algorithm is removed from the Child zone while
   the DS record set still references a key with that algorithm,
   validation errors may result.

   The SSAC therefore suggests that entities performing automated DS
   maintenance should report on error conditions they encounter.  Even
   when no update was requested, it may be worthwhile to occasionally
   check whether the current DS contents would be accepted today (see
   Appendix B.1), and communicate any failures without changing the
   published DS record set.

   The following situations may be of particular interest for being
   reported:

   1.  The DS record set has been provisioned

       a. manually, or

       b. automatically for initialization (DNSSEC bootstrapping), or

       c. for the first time after a manual change (so DS records are
       now under automatic maintenance, see Appendix B.2);

   2.  The DS record set has been removed

       a. manually, or

       b. automatically via the automation protocol's designated
       process;

   3.  A pending DS update cannot be applied due to an error condition.
       There are various scenarios where an automated DS update might
       have been requested, but can't be fulfilled.  These include:

       a.  The new DS record set would break validation/resolution or is
       not acceptable to the Parent for some other reason (see
       Appendix B.1);

       b.  A lock prevents DS automation (see Appendix B.3);

   4.  No DS update is due, but it was determined that the Child zone is
       no longer compatible with the existing DS record set (e.g. lack
       of DNSKEY algorithm).

   For these reportworthy cases, the entity performing DS automation
   would be justified to attempt communicating the situation.  Potential
   recipients are:

   *  Child DNS operator, via the report channel contained in the
      “Generalized DNS Notification” that triggered the DS update, or
      via email (from SOA contact data);

   *  Registrar (if DS automation is performed by the registry), via EPP
      (or similar channel);

   *  Registrant (domain holder) or technical contact, via email.

   For DS updates and deactivation (cases 1 and 2), it seems worthwhile
   to notify both the domain's technical contact and the registrant.
   This will typically lead to one notification during normal operation
   of a domain.

   For error conditions (cases 3 and 4), the registrant need not always
   be involved.  It seems advisable to first notify the domain's
   technical contact and the DNS operator serving the affected Child
   zone, and only if the problem persists for a prolonged amount of time
   (e.g., three days), notify the registrant.

   When the RRR model is used and the registry performs DS automation,
   the registrar should always stay informed of any DS changes, e.g.,
   via EPP (RFC 8590).

   During regular maintenance of a secure delegation, standard updates
   of DS record sets are not of particular interest.  In particular, if
   the delegation is already secure and a DS update has been applied
   automatically without any indication of irregularity, notifications
   to humans need not be triggered.

   Further, the same condition should not be reported unnecessarily
   frequently to the same recipient (e.g., no more than twice in a row).
   For example, when CDS and CDNSKEY records are inconsistent and
   prevent DS initialization, the registrant may be notified twice.
   Additional notifications may be sent with some back-off mechanism (in
   increasing intervals).

   The history of DS updates should be kept and, together with the
   currently active configuration, be made accessible to the registrant
   (or their designated party) through the customer portal available for
   domain management.

6.  Consistency Considerations

   *  Are DS parameters best conveyed via DS format or DNSKEY format (or
      both)?

   *  How are conflicts resolved?

6.1.  Analysis

   DS records can be generated from either DS-style or from DNSKEY-style
   input format.  The former is identical to that of DS records (so can
   be taken verbatim), while for the latter, generation of a DS record
   involves computing a hash and other information based on the DNSKEY-
   format information.

   Whether DS or DNSKEY format is ingested by the Parent depends on the
   Parent's preference:

   *  Conveying (and storing) parameters in DNSKEY format (such as via
      CDNSKEY records) allows the Parent to exert control over the
      choice of hash algorithms.  The Parent may then unilaterally
      regenerate DS records with a different choice of hash algorithm(s)
      whenever deemed appropriate.

   *  Conveying parameters in DS format (such as via CDS records) allows
      the Child DNS operator to control the hash digest type used in DS
      records, enabling the Child DNS operator to deploy (for example)
      experimental hash digests and removing the need for registry-side
      changes when new digest types become available.

   The need to make a choice in the face of this dichotomy is not
   particular to DS automation: Even when DNSSEC parameters are relayed
   to the Parent through conventional channels, the Parent has to make
   some choice about which format(s) to accept.

   Some registries have chosen to prefer DNSKEY-style input which
   seemingly comes with greater influence on the delegation's security
   properties (in particular, the DS hash digest type).  The SSAC notes
   that regardless of the choice of input format, the Parent cannot
   prevent the Child from following insecure cryptographic practices
   (such as insecure key storage, or using a key with insufficient
   entropy).  Besides, as the DS format contains a field indicating the
   hash digest type, objectionable ones (such as those outlawed by RFC
   8624) can still be rejected even when parameters are accepted as DS-
   style input, by inspecting that field.

   The fact that more than one input type needs to be considered burdens
   both Child DNS operators and Parents with the need to consider how to
   handle this dichotomy.  While the SSAC points out that this state of
   things is suboptimal, other community venues such as the IETF are
   better suited to address the dichotomy and evaluate the possibility
   of deprecating one of these mechanisms, with Parents transitioning to
   accepting input of the other type exclusively.

   In the meantime, it seems worthwhile for both Child DNS operators and
   Parents implementing automated DS maintenance to act as to maximize
   interoperability.  How that is best achieved depends on the
   automation mechanism in use.  In any case, it will be helpful to
   record the registry's practices in the DNSSEC Practice Statement
   (DPS).

   For CDS/CDNSKEY-based automation, the following additional
   considerations are offered:

   *  There exists no discovery protocol for the Parent's input format
      preference.  Recognizing that Child DNS operators are generally
      ignorant about which format the Parent prefers, they are
      encouraged to publish both CDNSKEY records as well as CDS records.
      The choice of hash digest type should follow current best
      practice, currently RFC 8624.

      The SSAC would like to emphasize that while publishing the same
      information in two different formats is not ideal, it seems to be
      the simpler choice (as opposed to requiring the DNS operator to
      bear the complexity cost of discovering which Parent prefers which
      format).  In order to avoid operational issues, DNS operators
      should take great care to make sure that published records are
      consistent with each other, for example by synthesizing them, or
      programmatically updating them at once.

   *  Parents, independently of their input format preference, are
      advised to require publication of both CDS and CDNSKEY records,
      and to enforce consistency between them, as determined by matching
      CDS and CDNSKEY records using hash digest algorithms whose support
      is required according to RFC 8624 Section 3.3.  (For CDS records
      using another, unsupported hash digest, consistency is undefined
      and thus not required.)

      By rejecting the DS update if either type is found missing or
      inconsistent with the other, Child DNS operators are held
      responsible when publishing contradictory information.  Registries
      can retain whatever benefit their choice carries for them, while
      at the same time facilitating a later revision of their choice.
      Similarly, this simplifies possible future deprecation of one of
      the two formats without breakage.

   In order to further reduce the risk of wrongful DS deployment such as
   from nameserver hijacking or negligent multi-signer operation, it
   seems helpful to ensure that CDS and CDNSKEY responses are consistent
   across nameservers.  This can be achieved by attempting to collect
   them from all authoritative nameservers listed in the delegation (one
   query per hostname suffices).  When a key is referenced in a CDS or
   CDNSKEY record set returned by one nameserver, but is missing from
   another nameserver's answer, the Child's intent is unclear, and DS
   provisioning should be aborted.  (TODO reference I-D.ietf-dnsop-cds-
   consistency).
